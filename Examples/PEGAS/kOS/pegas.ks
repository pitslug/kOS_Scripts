//	PEGAS - Powered Explicit Guidance Ascent System

//	This program should be called by a loader that has copied the necessary libraries and was itself called by a proper boot file which
//	has created and initialized the following global variables:
//		P_vName	STRING			vehicle name
//		P_seq	LIST of FLOAT	time table for a flight sequence, with following fields:
//								0	ignition (suggested a negative number - represents time for engines to reach full thrust before releasing)
//										important: ignition and clamp release HAVE to be two separate STAGE events! (maybe todo: staging standards? LEXICON?)
//								1	booster jettison (moment of jettisoning any side-mounted boosters, or 0 if none are present)
//								2	fairings jettison (as with boosters)
//								3	first stage cutoff
//								4	first stage separation
//								5	ullage motor ignition
//								6	second stage ignition
//								7	PEG activation (time for ullage motors to burn out and main engine to reach full thrust)
//								8	second stage max burn time (NOT related to T=0, rather to stage ignition time)
//		P_pt	LIST of FLOAT	time part of a first stage control program
//		P_pp	LIST of FLOAT	pitch part of a first stage control program
//		P_umode	INT				ullage motor for second stage: 0 - via stageable solid motors, >0 - via RCS
//								in case of RCS ullage, this also states for how long should the thrusters fire
